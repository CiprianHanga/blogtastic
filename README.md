# Blogtastic
Blog project in **__Practical PHP and MySQL__**, by Jono Bacon.

Wonderful idea ruined by sloppy execution. The book is filled with errors, I've tried my best to fix them and in some places had to make some minor changes.

The book is somewhat outdated but otherwise it's a great way to really understand how pure PHP is put to work in some real projects. Very helpful after you've completed a beginner's PHP course, learned a few things about the syntax and now you want to know more but you feel you don't know enough to get into more advanced stuff (frameworks, OOP, design patterns). What you need is to work (practice) with pure PHP on some basic projects and this book teaches you just that.

blogtastic_v1.zip - starting site mockup created in Appendix A.
- you will need to modify config.php to match your own working environment (path, port).
- in phpMyAdmin, create a database using the blogtastic.sql file provided and in the Privileges tab add an user with full privileges to the blogtastic database (User: Admin, password: secret, on Localhost)
